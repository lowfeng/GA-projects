## Problem Statement  

A real estate company is looking to sell their properties in the Ames, Iowa area and make a return on their investment. Hence, they are keen to know the valuation of their properties. They are also keen to know which housing features can contribute the most to the valuation, so that they can upgrade properties with a low ROI and appreciate its value.


## Data  


- [`train.csv`](./datasets/train.csv): Contains all of the training data for model
- [`new_test.csv`](./datasets/new_test.csv): Cntains the test data for model
- [`sample_sub_reg.csv`](./datasets/sample_sub_reg.csv): An example of a correctly formatted submission


## Research

* There are 80 variables focused on the quality and quantity of the many physical attributes of the property, with 2 additional observation identifiers. Most of the variables are information that a real estate company would want to know about a potential property.  

    * **20 continuous variables that relate to various area dimensions for each obseration**
        * Area measurements on the basement / main living area / porches are broken down into individual categories based on quality and type
        * Opportunity to use methods to combine the variables
    * **14 discrete variables to quantify the number of items within the house**
        * Number of kitchens / bedrooms / bathrooms located in the basement and above ground (grade).
        * Also included are the garage capacity and dates
    * **46 categorical variables, of which, 23 nominal & 23 ordinal**
        * Range from 2 to 28 classes with smallest being the street and largest being the neighbourhood.
        * Nominal variables identify various types of dwellings / garages / materials / environmental conditions
        * Ordinal variables rate items in the property
    * **2 observation identifiers**
        * The PID variable can be used in conjunction with the [Assessor's Office](http://www.cityofames.org/assessor/) or [Beacon](http://beacon.schneidercorp.com/) websites to directly view the records of a particular observation
    
    * **Others**
        * The neighbourhood variable can be used to model the location effect, and is of relevance when using the [map](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/AmesResidential.pdf)

## Findings

### EDA  

- The categorical (nominal & ordinal) variables will need to be mapped to numerical variables for its features to be useful in our modelling
- At first glance, columns 'Id','PID' seems like they won't be useful for modelling as they were random numbers for indexing the house, however we'll check this out later using a scatter plot to see if a relationship with 'SalePrice' exist
- Some features have similar names & functions which could be collinear, we'll verify their correlation using a heatmap
- There are missing values (Nan) which will need addressing
- Good to check for any duplicate rows
- Overall, there seems to be too many features, which would contribute to our model being overfitted. But we will take a slow iterative approach to this to avoid omitting features potentially useful for our model
#### Check for Duplicates / Outliers / Irrelevant Data / Target Variable

### Data Cleaning

#### Check for missing values
- 26 features with missing values
- Missing values were replaced with respective values (based on data documentation) and deductive imputation when required.
- Row with too many missing values were dropped

### Preprocessing and Feature Selection
- Features were combined or dropped due to collinearity
- Rank Ordinal Features
- Selected 45 Features for model
- One Hot Encode Nominal Features

## Conclusions 

The top features that increases the saleprice seems reasonable. The ground living area and overall quality of the house were top, followed by the quality of the kitchen and the exterior and if the house is in the NrighHt and StoneBr neighbourhood.

On the flip side, the features that decreases the saleprice the most were due to location and age of house. The townhouse (both end and inside unit)  and the age of the unit, followed by if the house was banked, and if it belonged in the Edwards neighbourhood.

Some features that increase the value of the house can be done through modifications or renovations, within the legal limits of the land.

While the production model is accurate for predicting saleprices of homes below $300,000, above that the error starts to get bigger. I belive this is due to a lack of data for homes with higher sale prices.

Interestingly, most of the top features are on the exterior. This information will help us in our recommendation to the client.


## Recommendations

Some recommendations to client for them to appreciate their property prices
- Focus on making home improvements in the kitchen and exterior, get an assessor to grade the quality
- If planning to increase the ground living area, you should build a bigger garage as this would bring the most value
- Include a fireplace and ensure that the heating around the house is good quality
- Consider changing the roof style to be hip.

Model should not be used on other cities as its not a generalized model. Each city has different external factors that affect the housing prices that might not be accounted for in this model, like its climate and economical position etc. For a generalised model, new features will need to be included and a new model will need to be fitted, although this would generally cause our model to have a larger variance as some features applied to the model will not be relevant to particular cities.
