    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "---\n",
    "Although ACT has been the overall leader since 2012, it was reported that more graduating seniors are taking the SAT in 2018<sup>1</sup>. The college board which owns the SAT has pushed to expand its market share through revising their test and making deals with states<sup>2</sup>. This project aims to explore trends in SAT and ACT participation for the years 2018-2019 and seeks to identify states that have significant changes in their SAT and ACT participation rates. It also seeks to know how the students are performing across states, and if this contributes to an increase in college acceptance.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "---\n",
    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",

    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",
